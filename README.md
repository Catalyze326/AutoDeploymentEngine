# Auto Deployment Engine

Run this on a server and then it will accept commands from my app to automatically deploy, start, stop or restart code from my GitHub.

It uses ssh keys to grab repos and then uses bash scripts that I wrote in all my repos to auto deploy, start, stop, or restart the code.

If you want to implement this it will probably be a pain so email me at (gmail.com@calebmorton98). You are going to have to install the flutter app, the mezzanine server and configure stuff on your github account.
